  My Name is Rian Zaki Ramadhan, I'm a 23-year-old self-taught front-end web
  developer with a passion for building clean, responsive, and user-friendly
  interfaces. Driven by curiosity and the desire to create, Iâ€™ve dedicated
  myself to learning modern web technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and
  frameworks such as React through hands-on projects and continuous practice. I
  enjoy turning ideas into interactive experiences and always seek opportunities
  to grow, collaborate, and contribute to meaningful digital solutions.
